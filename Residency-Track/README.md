# Residency Track

### After the leveling phase, in the second phase, the residents are engaged in studies focused on the embedded software track, which covers the following topics:
- Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- IoT Communication
- Sensor and Actuator Networks
- IoT Security
- Embedded Software and Hardware Integration
- Machine Learning

### During the trail phase, one activity was requested per unit and per topic.

### `01.` [tarefa1](tarefa1)

The objective of this activity was to develop a practical understanding of how to use tasks in the FreeRTOS real-time operating system, using the BitDogLab board. To do this, students had to implement three distinct tasks, all with the same priority, that will operated independently to apply multitasking concepts in an embedded system. The required tasks were:

1. LED Control: Create a task to make an LED connected to GPIO 12 blink continuously, remaining on for 50ms and off for 950ms.

2. Temperature Reading: Implement a task that reads the microcontroller's internal temperature, converts the value to degrees Celsius, and displays it every 2 seconds.

3. Joystick Reading: Develop a task to monitor a joystick, detecting and displaying the last valid direction pressed (Up, Down, Left, or Right).

The assembly features the presence of:
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- On-board temperature sensor
- SSD1306 OLED Display
- Joystick
- 1 LED
