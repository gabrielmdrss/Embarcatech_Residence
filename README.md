# Code Developed During the Embarcatech Technological Residency - IFRN

### Throughout 2025, I am a participant in the Embarcatech Technological Residency, specializing in the Embedded Software track. The program began with a two-month foundational period for all residents, covering the following subjects:
- Digital Systems
- Electronics

### Following this initial phase, residents are engaged in the Embedded Software track, which includes these topics:
- Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS)
- IoT Communication
- Sensor and Actuator Networks
- IoT Security
- Embedded Software and Hardware Integration
- Machine Learning

### Many of the program's activities involve creating documents and reports. For this reason, not all tasks are included in this repository, as it is specifically focused on code-based assignments.

### This repository contains the tasks from both stages of the Embarcatech program. The codes were developed using the BitDogLab development board, with the presence of a Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller. The environment used to create the code was VS Code, making use of the extension for programming using the Raspberry Pico.
